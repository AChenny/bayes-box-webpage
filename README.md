# bayes-box-webpage
Bayes Box Webpage is a website with the purpose of visualizing Bayesian Theory. The current build supports 3 events: Evidence, Event not happening, Event happening. The question being asked with the formula is "What is the probability of the event happening given the evidence we have?" 

## Future
<ul>
 <li>Add support for more events</li>
 <li>Add customizability for the event names</li>
</ul>

## Known Issues
<ul>
 <li>Moving the cursor too fast will cause the inner text to not resize properly</li>
</ul>
